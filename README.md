# Inspera Essay Drawing

Converts images in local directory to data URIs, so they can be drag & dropped into Inspera's "Essay" type questions.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies, `npm install`.
1. Start watching this directory, `npm start`.
1. Save images into this directory and see them appear in your browser.
1. Drag & drop into Inspera, _or_ right-click > copy image, paste into Inspera.

## Notes

Do _not_ insert images from a URL source. The image's URL is stored, which means the image can be changed _after submission_. To be safe, always convert images to data URIs.
